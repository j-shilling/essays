* Effective Learning

** Learning is Social

*** As social creatures, we need to externalize goals to make them 'real'

*** Knowledge without community is meaningless

*** Peer-interaction makes learning more active

**** Learning is a struggle

**** People who have finished the journey can offer a lot of insight, advice and correction

**** Only people still currently in the struggle can engage with us in a unique way that teachers and other experts can never fully simulate

** Learning is Emotional

** Learning is Exhausting

** Learning is Failure
